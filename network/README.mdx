## Data availability

The Stellar RPC, data indexers, Hubble, and Horizon are platforms or tools that facilitate communication between users and applications and the Stellar network. With these various platforms, users can query network data, submit transactions, and interact with smart contracts without needing to understand the low-level details of Stellar Core.

This section will walk you through the differences between the various platforms and tools, what platform or tool is best for what use case, and then link to their various documentation locations.

### Soroban RPC

If you are writing or interacting with smart contracts, you'll need to use RPC.
This is the best platform to see current state of the Stellar network.

### Data indexers

### Hubble

Hubble is your go-to source for viewing, analyzing, and understanding historic
data from the Stellar network.

[Learn more about Hubble here!](./hubble/README.mdx)

### Horizon

Horizon is an API for interacting with the Stellar network.

This API serves the bridge between apps and Stellar Core. Projects like wallets,
decentralized exchanges, and asset issuers use Horizon to submit transactions,
query an account balance, or stream events like transactions to an account.

## Platforms

### Anchor Platform

The Anchor Platform is a set of tools and APIs that enable developers and
businesses to build their own on and off-ramp services for the Stellar network.
It provides a standardized interface, including the implementation of several
Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), to make it easy for businesses to integrate
with Stellar-based wallets and exchanges.

### Stellar Disbursement Platform

The Stellar Disbursement Platform (SDP) enables organizations to disburse bulk
payments to recipients using Stellar.
