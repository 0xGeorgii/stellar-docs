| asset_code | string | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |

| batch_id | string | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities |
| batch_run_date | datetime | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. |
| batch_insert_ts | timestamp | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes. |
