| Column Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| history_operation_id | int64 | The operation id associated with the executed trade. The total amount traded in an operation can be broken up into multiple smaller trades spread across multiple orders by multiple parties<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />There is a many to one relationship for history_operation_id with the history_operations table. |
| ledger_closed_at | timestamp | The timestamp in UTC when the ledger with this trade was closed.<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field |
| selling_account_address | string | The account address of the selling party |
| selling_asset_code | string | The 4 or 12 character code of the sold asset within a trade<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |
| selling_asset_issuer | string | The account address of the original asset issuer for the sold asset within a trade |
| selling_asset_type | string | The identifier for type of asset code used for the sold asset within the trade<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native' |
| selling_amount | float64 | The amount of sold asset that was moved from the seller account to the buyer account, reported in terms of the sold amount<br /><br />- Required Field |
| buying_account_address | string | The account address of the buying party |
| buying_asset_code | string | The 4 or 12 character code of the bought asset within a trade<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |
| buying_asset_issuer | string | The account address of the original asset issuer for the bought asset within a trade |
| buying_asset_type | string | The identifier for type of asset code used for the bought asset within the trade<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native' |
| buying_amount | float64 | The amount of purchased asset that was moved from the seller account into the buying account, reported in terms of the bought asset.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| price_n | int64 | The price ratio of the sold asset: bought asset. When taken with price_d, the price can be calculated by price_n/price_d |
| price_d | int64 | The price ratio of the sold asset: bought asset. When taken with price_n, the price can be calculated by price_n/price_d |
| selling_offer_id | int64 | The offer ID in the orderbook of the selling offer. If this offer was immediately and fully consumed, this will be a synthetic ID. |
| buying_offer_id | int64 | The offer ID in the orderbook of the buying offer. If this offer was immediately and fully consumed, this will be a synthetic ID. |
| batch_id | string | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities |
| batch_run_date | datetime | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. |
| batch_insert_ts | timestamp | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes. |
| selling_liquidity_pool_id | string | The unique identifier for a liquidity pool if the trade was executed against a liquidity pool instead of the orderbook |
| liquidity_pool_fee | int64 | The percentage fee (in basis points) of the total fee collected by the liquidity pool for executing the trade.<br />The fee is pooled and distributed back to liquidity pool shareholders to incentivize users to stake money in the pool.<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Default Values</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>30</td> </tr> </tbody> </table><br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Liquidity pool fees can only change with protocol changes to the network itself |
| trade_type | int64 | Indicates whether the trade was executed against the orderbook (decentralized exchange) or liquidity pool.<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Code</th> <th>Value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Descentralized Exchange Trade</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Liquidity Pool Trade</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| rounding_slippage | int64 | Applies to liquidity pool trades only. With fractional amounts of an asset traded, the network must round a fraction to the nearest whole number. This can cause the trade to "slip" price by a percentage compared with the original offer. Rounding slippage reports the percentage that dust trades slip before executing.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Defaults to 1<br />Rounding Slippage is always unprofitable for the trader and is not a valid way to try and extract more value from the network. |
| seller_is_exact | bool | Indicates whether the buying or selling party trade was impacted by rounding slippage. If true, the buyer was impacted. If false, the seller was impacted |
| selling_asset_id | int64 | Unique identifier for the asset code, type and issuer combination. This is not a primary key on the table<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Required |
| buying_asset_id | int64 | Unique identifier for the asset code, type and issuer combination. This is not a primary key on the table<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Required |
