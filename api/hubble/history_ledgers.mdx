| Column Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sequence | int64 | The sequence number that corresponds to the individual ledgers. As ledgers are written to the network, the sequence is incremented by 1<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field |
| ledger_hash | string | The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash that represents the ledger's XDR-encoded form<br /><br />- Required Field |
| previous_ledger_hash | string | The hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the ledger that immediately precedes this ledger |
| transaction_count | int64 | The number of successful transactions submitted and completed by the network in this ledger<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Defaults to 0 |
| operation_count | int64 | The total number of successful operations applied to this ledger<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Defaults to 0 |
| closed_at | timestamp | Timestamp in UTC when this ledger closed and committed to the network. Ledgers are expected to close ~every 5 seconds<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field |
| id | int64 | Unique identifier for the ledger<br /><br />- Primary Key |
| total_coins | int64 | Total number of lumens in circulation<br /><br />- Required Field |
| fee_pool | int64 | The sum of all transaction fees<br /><br />- Required Field |
| base_fee | int64 | The fee (in stroops) the network charges per operation in a transaction for the given ledger. The minimum base fee is 100, with the ability to increase if transaction demand exceeds ledger capacity. When this occurs, the ledger enters surge pricing.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />The stroop is the fractional representation of a lumen (XLM). 1 stroop is 0.0000001 XLM. |
| base_reserve | int64 | The reserve (in stroops) the network requires an account to retain as a minimum balance in order to be a valid account on the network. The current minimum reserve is 10 XLM.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />The stroop is the fractional representation of a lumen (XLM). 1 stroop is 0.0000001 XLM. |
| max_tx_set_size | int64 | The maximum number of operations that Stellar validator nodes have agreed to process in a given ledger. Since Protocol 11, ledger capacity has been measured in operations rather than transactions.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| protocol_version | int64 | The protocol verstion that the Stellar network was running when this ledger was committed. Protocol versions are released ~every 6 months.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| ledger_header | bytes | A base64-encoded string of the raw LedgerHeader xdr struct for this ledger |
| successful_transaction_count | int64 | The number of successful transactions submitted and completed by the network in this ledger |
| failed_transaction_count | int64 | The number of failed transactions submitted to the network in this ledger. The transaction was still paid for but contained an error that prevented it from executing |
| tx_set_operation_count | int64 | The total number of operations in the transaction set for this ledger, including failed transactions. |
| batch_id | string | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities |
| batch_run_date | datetime | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. |
| batch_insert_ts | timestamp | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes. |
