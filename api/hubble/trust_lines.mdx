When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account. Depending on the state table, flags can have various meanings.<br /><br />#### `accounts` and `claimable_balances`:<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None - Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Auth Required (all trustlines by default are untrusted and require manual trust established)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Auth Revocable (allows trustlines to be revoked if account no longer trusts asset)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Auth Immutable (all auth flags are read only when set)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Auth Clawback Enabled (asset can be clawed back from the user)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>offers</code>:</h4> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Passive (offer with this flag will not act on and take a reverse offer of equal price)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>trust_lines</code>:</h4> <p>Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None, Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Authorized (issuer has authorized account to perform transaction with its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Authorized to Maintain Liabilities (issuer has authorized account to maintain and reduce liabilities for its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Clawback Enabled (issuer has specified that it may clawback its credit, including claimable balances)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| ledger_entry_change | int64 | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Not every ledger entry can be updated, some are only created or deleted. Pay attention to types that are not valid for certain ledger entries.<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th> <th><strong>Not</strong> Valid For</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Ledger Entry Created</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Ledger Entry Updated</td> <td>claimable balances</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Ledger Entry Deleted</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| deleted | bool | Indicates whether the ledger entry (account, claimable balance, trust line, offer, liquidity pool) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered.<br /><br />All state tables maintain history for deleted ledger entries.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| batch_id | string | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities |
| batch_run_date | datetime | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. |
| batch_insert_ts | timestamp | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes. |
| sponsor | string | The account address of the sponsor who is paying the reserves for this ledger entry.<br /><br />The following ledger entry types can be sponsored:<br /><br /> - accounts<br /> - account signers<br /> - claimable balances<br /> - trust lines<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Sponsors of claimable balances are the accounts that created the balance. |
