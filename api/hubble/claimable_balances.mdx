| Column Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| balance_id | string | A unique identifier for this claimable balance. The Balance id is a compilation of `Balance Type` + `SHA-256 hash history_operation_id`<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />The Balance Type is fixed at V0, `00000000`. If there is a protocol change that materially impacts the mechanics of claimable balances, the balance type would update to V1. |
| claimants | record | The list of entries which are eligible to claim the balance and preconditions that must be fulfilled to claim.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Multiple accounts can be specified in the claimants record, including the account of the balance creator. |
| claimants.destination | string | The account id who can claim the balance.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| claimants.predicate | record | The condition which must be satisfied so the destination can claim the balance. The predicate can include logical rules using AND, OR and NOT logic.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| claimants.predicate.abs_before | string | Deadline for when the balance must be claimed. If a balance is claimed before the date then the clause of the condition is satisfied. |
| claimants.predicate.abs_before_epoch | int64 | A UNIX epoch value in seconds representing the same deadline date as abs_before. |
| claimants.predicate.rel_before | int64 | A relative deadline for when the claimable balance can be claimed. The value represents the number of seconds since the close time of the ledger which created the claimable balance<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />This condition is useful when creating a timebounds based on creation conditions. If the creator wanted a balance only claimable one week after creation, this condition would satisfy that rule. |
| claimants.predicate.unconditional | bool | If true it means this clause of the condition is always satisfied.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />When the predicate is only unconditional = true, it means that the balance can be claimed under any conditions |
| asset_type | string | The identifier for type of asset code, can be an alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native' |
| asset_code | string | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |
| asset_issuer | string | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset. |
| asset_amount | float64 | The amount of the asset that can be claimed.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| sponsor | string | The account address of the sponsor who is paying the reserves for this ledger entry.<br /><br />The following ledger entry types can be sponsored:<br /><br /> - accounts<br /> - account signers<br /> - claimable balances<br /> - trust lines<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Sponsors of claimable balances are the accounts that created the balance. |
| flags | int64 | Denotes the enabling and disabling of certain asset issuer privileges.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account. Depending on the state table, flags can have various meanings.<br /><br />#### `accounts` and `claimable_balances`:<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None - Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Auth Required (all trustlines by default are untrusted and require manual trust established)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Auth Revocable (allows trustlines to be revoked if account no longer trusts asset)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Auth Immutable (all auth flags are read only when set)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Auth Clawback Enabled (asset can be clawed back from the user)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>offers</code>:</h4> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Passive (offer with this flag will not act on and take a reverse offer of equal price)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>trust_lines</code>:</h4> <p>Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None, Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Authorized (issuer has authorized account to perform transaction with its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Authorized to Maintain Liabilities (issuer has authorized account to maintain and reduce liabilities for its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Clawback Enabled (issuer has specified that it may clawback its credit, including claimable balances)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| last_modified_ledger | int64 | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry was last modified. Deletions do not count as a modification and will report the prior modification sequence number<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />As an example, if an account updates a signer's weight at sequence 1234 and then decides to delete the signer at 2345, the deleted record will still have a modified sequence of 1234. The `last_modified_ledger` **is not** a proxy for entry deletion time and should not be used in such a manner. Deletion times can be approximated with `batch_run_date`. |
| ledger_entry_change | int64 | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Not every ledger entry can be updated, some are only created or deleted. Pay attention to types that are not valid for certain ledger entries.<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th> <th><strong>Not</strong> Valid For</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Ledger Entry Created</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Ledger Entry Updated</td> <td>claimable balances</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Ledger Entry Deleted</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| deleted | bool | Indicates whether the ledger entry (account, claimable balance, trust line, offer, liquidity pool) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered.<br /><br />All state tables maintain history for deleted ledger entries.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| batch_id | string | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities |
| batch_run_date | datetime | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. |
| batch_insert_ts | timestamp | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes. |
