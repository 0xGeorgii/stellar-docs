| Column Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| account_id | string | The address of the account. The address is the account's public key encoded in base32. All account addresses start with a 'G'.<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field |
| balance | float64 | The number of units of XLM held by the account<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. |
| buying_liabilities | float64 | The sum of all buy offers owned by this account for XLM only<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. For buy offers, the account must hold the amount of asset to complete the transaction |
| selling_liabilities | float64 | The sum of all sell offers owned by this account for XLM only<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />The `accounts` table only reports monetary balances for XLM. Any other asset class is reported in the `trust_lines` table. |
| sequence_number | int64 | The account's current sequence number. The sequence number controls operations applied to an account. Operations must submit a unique sequence number that is incremented by 1 in order to apply the operation to the account so that account changes will not collide within a ledger.<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Required Field |
| num_subentries | int64 | The total number of ledger entries connected to this account. Ledger entries include: trustlines, offers, signers, and data entries. (Claimable balances are counted under sponsoring entries, not subentries). Any newly created trustline, offer, signer or data entry will increase the number of subentries by 1. Accounts may have up to 1,000 subentries<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Each entry on a ledger takes up space, which is expensive to store on the blockchain. For each entry, an account is required to hold a [minimum XLM balance](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/lumens#minimum-balance). The reserve is calculated by (2 + num_subentries - num_sponsoring + num_sponsored) * 0.5XLM |
| inflation_destination | string | Deprecated: The account address to receive an inflation payment when they are disbursed on the network.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Inflation was discontinued in 2019 by validator vote. |
| flags | int64 | Denotes the enabling and disabling of certain asset issuer privileges.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account. Depending on the state table, flags can have various meanings.<br /><br />#### `accounts` and `claimable_balances`:<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None - Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Auth Required (all trustlines by default are untrusted and require manual trust established)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Auth Revocable (allows trustlines to be revoked if account no longer trusts asset)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Auth Immutable (all auth flags are read only when set)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Auth Clawback Enabled (asset can be clawed back from the user)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>offers</code>:</h4> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Passive (offer with this flag will not act on and take a reverse offer of equal price)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>trust_lines</code>:</h4> <p>Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None, Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Authorized (issuer has authorized account to perform transaction with its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Authorized to Maintain Liabilities (issuer has authorized account to maintain and reduce liabilities for its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Clawback Enabled (issuer has specified that it may clawback its credit, including claimable balances)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| home_domain | string | The domain that hosts this account's stellar.toml file.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Only applies to asset issuer accounts. The stellar.toml file contains metadata about the asset issuer which helps identify who the issuer is and instills trust in the asset |
| master_weight | int64 | The weight of the master key, which is the private key for this account. If a master key is '0', the account is locked and cannot be used.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Accepted Values</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Integers from 1 to 255</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| threshold_low | int64 | The sum of the weight of all signatures that sign a transaction for the low threshold operation. The weight must exceed the set threshold for the operation to succeed.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Each operation falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium or high. Thresholds define the level of privilege an operation needs in order to succeed (this is a security measure)<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Security</th> <th>Operations</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Low</td> <td>Allow Trust, Set Trust Line Flags, Bump Sequence and Claim Claimable Balance</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Medium</td> <td>Everything Else</td> </tr> <tr> <td>High</td> <td>Account Merge, Set Options</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| threshold_medium | int64 | The sum of the weight of all signatures that sign a transaction for the medium threshold operation. The weight must exceed the set threshold for the operation to succeed.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Each operation falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium or high. Thresholds define the level of privilege an operation needs in order to succeed (this is a security measure)<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Security</th> <th>Operations</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Low</td> <td>Allow Trust, Set Trust Line Flags, Bump Sequence and Claim Claimable Balance</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Medium</td> <td>Everything Else</td> </tr> <tr> <td>High</td> <td>Account Merge, Set Options</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| threshold_high | int64 | The sum of the weight of all signatures that sign a transaction for the high threshold operation. The weight must exceed the set threshold for the operation to succeed.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Each operation falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium or high. Thresholds define the level of privilege an operation needs in order to succeed (this is a security measure)<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Security</th> <th>Operations</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Low</td> <td>Allow Trust, Set Trust Line Flags, Bump Sequence and Claim Claimable Balance</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Medium</td> <td>Everything Else</td> </tr> <tr> <td>High</td> <td>Account Merge, Set Options</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| last_modified_ledger | int64 | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry was last modified. Deletions do not count as a modification and will report the prior modification sequence number<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />As an example, if an account updates a signer's weight at sequence 1234 and then decides to delete the signer at 2345, the deleted record will still have a modified sequence of 1234. The `last_modified_ledger` **is not** a proxy for entry deletion time and should not be used in such a manner. Deletion times can be approximated with `batch_run_date`. |
| ledger_entry_change | int64 | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Not every ledger entry can be updated, some are only created or deleted. Pay attention to types that are not valid for certain ledger entries.<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th> <th><strong>Not</strong> Valid For</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Ledger Entry Created</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Ledger Entry Updated</td> <td>claimable balances</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Ledger Entry Deleted</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| deleted | bool | Indicates whether the ledger entry (account, claimable balance, trust line, offer, liquidity pool) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered.<br /><br />All state tables maintain history for deleted ledger entries.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| batch_id | string | String representation of the run id for a given DAG in Airflow. Takes the form of "scheduled__<batch_end_date>-<dag_alias>". Batch ids are unique to the batch and help with monitoring and rerun capabilities |
| batch_run_date | datetime | The start date for the batch interval. When taken with the date in the batch_id, the date represents the interval of ledgers processed. The batch run date can be seen as a proxy of closed_at for a ledger. |
| batch_insert_ts | timestamp | The timestamp in UTC when a batch of records was inserted into the database. This field can help identify if a batch executed in real time or as part of a backfill. The timestamp should not be used during ad hoc analysis and is useful for data engineering purposes. |
| sponsor | string | The account address of the sponsor who is paying the reserves for this ledger entry.<br /><br />The following ledger entry types can be sponsored:<br /><br /> - accounts<br /> - account signers<br /> - claimable balances<br /> - trust lines<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Sponsors of claimable balances are the accounts that created the balance. |
| num_sponsored | int64 | The number of reserves sponsored for this account (meaning another account is paying for the minimum balance). Sponsored entries do not incur any reserve requirement on the account that owns the entry.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Defaults to 0<br />Accounts, offers, trustlines, data and signers can be optionally sponsored. Claimable Balances must be sponsored. See more information on sponsorship [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/encyclopedia/sponsored-reserves). |
| num_sponsoring | int64 | The number of reserves sponsored by this account. Entries sponsored by this account incur a reserve requirement.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Defaults to 0<br />Accounts, offers, trustlines, data and signers can be optionally sponsored. Claimable Balances must be sponsored. See more information on sponsorship [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/encyclopedia/sponsored-reserves). |
| sequence_ledger | int64 | The unsigned 32-bit ledger number of the sequence number's age.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Reflects the last time an account touched its sequence number. Note that even if the Bump Sequence operation has no effect, eg it does not increase the sequence number, it still counts as a "touch" |
| sequence_time | timestamp | The UNIX timestamp of the sequence number's age.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Reflects the last time an account touched its sequence number. Note that even if the Bump Sequence operation has no effect, eg it does not increase the sequence number, it still counts as a "touch" |
