| Column Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| seller_id | string | The account address that is making this offer.<br /><br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field |
| offer_id | int64 | The unique identifier for this offer.<br /><br />- Required Field |
| selling_asset_type | string | The identifier for type of asset code, can be an alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native' |
| selling_asset_code | string | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |
| selling_asset_issuer | string | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset. |
| buying_asset_type | string | The identifier for type of asset code, can be an alphanumeric with 4 characters, 12 characters or the native asset to the network, XLM.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />XLM is the native asset to the network. XLM has no asset code or issuer representation and will instead be displayed with an asset type of 'native' |
| buying_asset_code | string | The 4 or 12 character code representation of the asset on the network.<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Asset codes have no guarantees of uniqueness. The combination of asset code, issuer and type represents a distinct asset |
| buying_asset_issuer | string | The account address of the original asset issuer that created the asset. |
| amount | float64 | The raw number of units of an asset. Precision for an amount is 10^-7 of the asset token. For example, XLM is scaled down to a denomination of a **stroop,** where 10,000,000 stroops = 1 XLM. More information about amount precision can be found [here](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/stellar-data-structures/assets#amount-precision).<br /><br />- Required Field |
| price | float64 | How many units of buying it takes to get 1 unit of selling. This number is the decimal form of pricen / priced.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />If an offer wants to sell 10 XLM for 1 USD, the price will be 0.10 USD. |
| flags | int64 | Denotes the enabling and disabling of certain asset issuer privileges.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account. Depending on the state table, flags can have various meanings.<br /><br />#### `accounts` and `claimable_balances`:<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None - Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Auth Required (all trustlines by default are untrusted and require manual trust established)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Auth Revocable (allows trustlines to be revoked if account no longer trusts asset)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Auth Immutable (all auth flags are read only when set)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Auth Clawback Enabled (asset can be clawed back from the user)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>offers</code>:</h4> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Passive (offer with this flag will not act on and take a reverse offer of equal price)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h4><code>trust_lines</code>:</h4> <p>Flags are set on the issuer accounts for an asset. When user accounts trust an asset, the flags applied to the asset originate from this account.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>None, Default</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Authorized (issuer has authorized account to perform transaction with its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Authorized to Maintain Liabilities (issuer has authorized account to maintain and reduce liabilities for its credit)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Clawback Enabled (issuer has specified that it may clawback its credit, including claimable balances)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| last_modified_ledger | int64 | The ledger sequence number when the ledger entry was last modified. Deletions do not count as a modification and will report the prior modification sequence number<br /><br />- Natural Key<br />- Cluster Field<br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />As an example, if an account updates a signer's weight at sequence 1234 and then decides to delete the signer at 2345, the deleted record will still have a modified sequence of 1234. The `last_modified_ledger` **is not** a proxy for entry deletion time and should not be used in such a manner. Deletion times can be approximated with `batch_run_date`. |
| ledger_entry_change | int64 | Code that describes the ledger entry change type that was applied to the ledger entry.<br /><br />- Required Field<br /><br />#### Notes:<br />Not every ledger entry can be updated, some are only created or deleted. Pay attention to types that are not valid for certain ledger entries.<br /><br /><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Value</th> <th>Description</th> <th><strong>Not</strong> Valid For</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>0</td> <td>Ledger Entry Created</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Ledger Entry Updated</td> <td>claimable balances</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Ledger Entry Deleted</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |
| deleted | bool | Indicates whether the ledger entry (account, claimable balance, trust line, offer, liquidity pool) has been deleted or not. Once an entry is deleted, it cannot be recovered.<br /><br />All state tables maintain history for deleted ledger entries.<br /><br />- Required Field |
