Bridges and messaging layers that connect different blockchains.

## [Axelar](https://www.axelar.network/)

Axelar is an interchain platform that connects blockchains, enabling cross-chain communication and universal Web3 transactions.

Get set up to write cross-chain smart contracts on Stellar using Axelar in the following guides.

### Learn about the [Stellar GMP contracts](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/general-message-passing/stellar-gmp/intro/).

General Message Passing (GMP) is a cross-chain communication protocol that allows smart contracts on different blockchains to communicate with each other.

### Learn about the [Stellar Interchange Token Service (ITS)](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/send-tokens/stellar/intro/).

ITS opens up possibilities to interact with tokens from other blockchains without understanding the intricacies of each chainâ€™s token standards.
