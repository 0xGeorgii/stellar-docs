This section showcases real-world use cases of the Ingest Library, focusing on key components like `ingest.LedgerTransaction`, `ingest.LedgerChange`, `ingest.LedgerTransactionReader`, and `ingest.ChangeReader`.

These examples either taken in a Stellar Ledger (`xdr.LedgerCloseMeta`) or a ledger sequence range (start-end). Each of the examples listed here is complete, and can be taken as-is, compiled and run in your IDE/local dev.

## Prerequisites

Some of the examples listed here might require a local instance of captive-core. At a minimum, you will need a `stellar-core` binary that has been compiled for your platform. Refer "admin guide" for more details.
