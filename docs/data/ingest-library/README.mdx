The [ingest library](https://github.com/stellar/go/tree/master/ingest) in the Stellar Go mono-repo provides tools for efficiently processing and analyzing the data from Stellar ledgers. It is designed to ingest and parse ledger data, including transactions, changes, and events, providing a way for developers to derive useful information about the state of the ledger.

The library enables developers to process large sets of data in a scalable manner, exposing important data types and methods to work with ledger entries, transactions, and the state of accounts.

This section explains the key components of the /ingest library, particularly focusing on the prominent data types it exposes, the process of deriving changes from a ledger, and how tools like `transaction_reader` and `change_reader` can be used to read and extract transactions and events from the ledger.
